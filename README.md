Java game of Blackjack

Run the program.

When prompted, enter your name.

The program will then initialize two sets of cards for the player and the dealer. It will also print out the initial cards and scores for the player and the dealer.

The player will be prompted to either "hit" or "stay" by entering "h" or "s" respectively.

If the player chooses to "hit", the program will add a new random card to the player's hand and will print out the updated cards and score for the player. If the player's score is 21 or over 21, the game will end.

If the player chooses to "stay", the program will move on to the dealer's turn. The dealer will draw new cards until the dealer's score is 17 or higher, unless the player has bust.

The program will then print out the final cards and scores for both the player and the dealer.

The program will then determine the winner based on the scores and print the result.

The game will end.

Please note that this is a simple version of the game and there are many more rules and variations in actual Blackjack game.
